    <h2>My 2022 Book Review</h2>
    <p>For my JavaScript-based interactive feature, I chose to create a presentation slide show of all the books I 
        have read so far in 2022. I found inspiration for this feature from our Image Carousel Weekly Assignment and 
        decided to riff off of that to create something I was proud of. I love reading and wanted to make a place to keep
        a list of books and ratings for friend/family recommendations, book clubs and more.

      <div class="text"> My Body, By Em Rata 
        <p>5/5</p>
        <!-- <br> -->
        <p>I became obsessed with this book as soon as I started it and couldn't stop. I listened to it on Audible,</p>
        <p>which Emily Ratajkowski herself narrates. I feel like with social media, we are given a perspective of </p>
        <p> peoples lives through posts and stories but I feel like I really got to know Emily in this book,</p>
        <p> her rise to fame, and all the travesties she faced. This book was filled with raw emotion, honest and </p>
        <p> heart breaking truth telling that needs to be revealed more about being a young woman in the spotlight. </p>
        <p> She talks about her relationships with her mother, being a mother, powerful men taking advantage of  </p>
        <p> women in the industry and her relationship with her body. It was beautiful and important and a must read.</p>

      <div class="text">Where the Crawdads Sing, by Delia Owens
        <p>-/5</p>
        <p>This book currently does not have a rating because it is still in progress. So far, I have liked it. I would  </p>
        <p>recommend this book to anyone with an appreciation for nature, good storytelling and beauty, as well as   </p>
        <p>anyone who is looking for a bit of mystery threaded into their story. The imagery is phenomenal and it is </p>
        <p>truly a story of survival. The timeline of the book is interesting, as it jumps from present day to the past and </p>
        <p>paints the story of a murder. I have heard mixed reviews so I am intrigued to finish and will update when I'm done.</p>
        <p>Also, it was just made into a movie and I am excited to finish this book so I can watch it.</p>

      <div class="text">Elvis and Me, By Priscilla Beaulieu Presley
        <p>4/5</p>
        <p>I read this book after seeing the Elvis movie this summer and becoming slightly obsessed. I enjoyed it </p>
        <p>very much as it is told by the famous Priscilla and tells the story of her and Elvis' epic romance. </p>
        <p>Once again, I listened to this book on Audible and enjoyed listening to her recount her times with him </p>
        <p>and all the emotions that came with it. I would definitley recommend to any Elvis fan as a necessary read. It made</p>
        <p>me cry, laugh, and dance. I loved how it painted an honest picture of one of the biggest celebrity couples in </p>
        <p>history. Reading it was like sitting down for coffee with Priscilla and listening to her wonderful stories.</p>

        <div class="text">Rules of Civility, By Amor Towles
            <p>5/5</p>
        <p>This book was another one of my favorites of 2022. I listened to this book while driving my car out to Colorado </p>
        <p>with my dad this past summer. It transports readers to another time and place: New York City in the 1930s. It is a coming</p>
        <p>of age story that follows a girl in her early twenties and takes readers through every season of her life. It was</p>
        <p>definitely a love letter to NYC and all the opportunities that present themselves just through people you meet and</p>
        <p>adventures you find yourself pursuing. I found myself relating to it a lot as I was starting a new job and I just  </p>
        <p>loved it. Perfect score</p>
        <p></p>

        <img src="./img/pride.jpg" style="width:40%">
        <div class="text">Pride and Prejudice, By Jane Austen
            <p>5/5</p>
        <p>Being a classic, I knew this book was going to be hard to get into but this is an amazing book. The enemies </p>
        <p>to lovers trope always makes for an incredibly romantic read. However, this book is not just about the </p>
        <p>romance, but Jane Austen's writing style. This book contains subtle humor, witty insights and her view of</p>
        <p> society and people's morals. I think everyone should read this book at least once in their life. Being my</p>
        <p> first classic, I watched the movie before and took annotations on the pages to help me comprehend the  </p>
        <p> older language but consider this as being one of the best books I have ever read. Obviously,  </p>
        <p>because it is Jane Austen.</p>

        <div class="text">Call Me By Your Name, By Andr√© Aciman
            <p>5/5</p>
            <p>I read this book this past summer having just spent the semster in Florence, Italy and it made me 
            </p><p>  want to go back. This book takes place in nothern Italy in the mid eighties during summertime. 
            </p><p> It was very enjoyable and I loved how poetic the author's language was in describing different 
            </p><p> aspects of the book, including the scenery, romance and relationships. It was an amazing story 
            </p><p> of love and finding yourself. The ending was heart wrenching and portrayed the true tragedy of 
            </p><p> moving on from a pivotal love and being forced to live in that new reality. Although painful,
            </p><p> true love is powerful and beautiful.

        <img src="./img/flicker.jpg" style="width:40%">
        <div class="text">A Flicker in the Dark, By Stacy Willingham
            <p>3/5</p>
            <p>This is a great suspense thriller that follows the daughter of a serial killer. The story is told through </p>
            <p>anxious first-person narration in the present with flashbacks to her childhood, which builds up the tension well.</p>
            <p> The author definitely puts you through a hauntingly compelling journey. While this book did keep me on the edge </p>
            <p>of my seat and I was guessing what was going to happen up until the end, it received a sub-par rating because </p>
            <p>the ending was not great and left a lot of questions unanswered.</p>

        <img src="./img/tmrw.jpg" style="width:40%">
        <div class="text">Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow, By Gabrielle Zevin
            <p>5/5</p>
        <p>This was the most brilliant book I have read all year. I found myself absorbed in a fictional world with</p>
        <p>not only excellent characters and plot, but a scavenger hunt of plays on perspective, voice and setting.</p>
        <p>This book was very nostalgic and read more like a play than a novel. The writing was phenomenal  </p>
        <p>and examined life through an interesting lens of starting over when life presents us with difficult </p>
        <p>situations. So good and so beautiful, would highly recommend. </p>

        <div class="text">The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, By Taylor Jenkins Reid
            <p>3/5</p>
        <p>This book was recommended to me by seemingly the entire world. Everyone raved about how good it </p>
        <p>was, how it was the best book of 2021 and 2022, etc. I definitely liked it and the old bombshell   </p>
        <p>Hollywood aesthetic but thought it was a little overrated. It took me longer than expected to read  </p>
        <p>because it got a little old and slow at some points but other than that, it was an epic love story </p>
        <p> filled with romance and tragedy. The characters were fabulous and there is a big plot twist.</p>
