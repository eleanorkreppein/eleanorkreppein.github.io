    <p></p>

    <p>As a recent graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder's Leeds School of Business, with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and a minor in Creative Technology and Design, I have acquired a solid foundation in both the strategic and creative aspects of business. Additionally, my coursework at Florence University of the Arts in Italy broadened my understanding of international business and cultural dynamics, which I believe would be valuable in global-oriented companies. </p>

        <p>During my internship at Ogilvy, I honed my project management skills and had the opportunity to lead a team of individuals from various locations and time zones. Through this experience, I successfully managed a project within a $100,000 budget, developed competitive audits and creative briefs, and implemented a comprehensive 12-month marketing campaign. I also conducted user research, utilizing qualitative and quantitative methodologies, to identify pain points and design empathy-focused solutions. My ability to collaborate across cross-functional teams and effectively communicate findings to stakeholders contributed to the success of the project. In addition to my professional experiences, I have demonstrated leadership through my involvement in organizations such as Classroom Central and Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority. Through my role as a Volunteer Intern at Classroom Central, I organized large-scale fundraising campaigns and fostered a love for learning among young students. As the Newsletter and Second Datebook Chair for Kappa Alpha Theta Sorority, I directed content creation and distribution to enhance chapter participation rates and engagement.</p>
        
        <p>With my technical skills in front-end web development, proficiency in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, and Google Ads Search and Google Analytics certifications, I bring a comprehensive toolkit to support project implementation and drive marketing initiatives. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to company projects and deliver exceptional results. The prospect of working in a dynamic and innovative environment where collaboration and creativity thrive strongly aligns with my career aspirations.
        My resume can be found on the second page of this website and I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with the needs of your company. </p>
