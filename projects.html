    <h2>Cool Projects</h2> 

    <p>As a student in the Leeds School of Business, I have worked on many product launches and research analytics projects. Some of my favorite and most applicable 
        marketing courses include Marketing Research and Analytics, Buyer Behavior, Pricing and Channels and Product Strategy.
        I am also pursuing a Certificate in Global Business. I studied for a semester in Florence, Italy, where I 
        was taught International Marketing, International Management, Renaissance Art History, and Wine Culture in Italy. 
        As a Creative Technology Design minor, I have taken many classes that I have had to apply many skills of problem solving and creativity. 
        A few of the classes I have taken include Design Foundations, Computational Foundations, Meaning of Informational Technology and Image. Here are some
        of the cool projects I have done in my career.
    </p>

<p>Last fall, I took Computational Foundations and coded this solar system with interactive stars for my final project. Also in Computational Foundations, I created this generative art piece using Python Spyder. </p>
